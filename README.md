### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase i performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling of missing values.

### Reports creation/Visualization
Three Dashboards were created they include:
1. Views and Subscription : To analyze audience engagement and growth potential.
2. Earnings: To provide insights into the financial performance of YouTubers.
3. Country: To analyze YouTube performance by geographical location.

The creation of these dashboards allows for a holistic view of the YouTube ecosystem, enabling users to make informed decisions based on data. By breaking down the analysis into these three key areas—views and subscriptions, earnings, and country-specific data—stakeholders can better understand the dynamics of YouTube, optimize their strategies, and achieve greater success on the platform.


### Results/Findings

2. The United States and India are the top countries in terms of earnings, subscriber counts, and video views.
3. While Entertainment dominates, categories like Music and Gaming also show significant performance in terms of views, uploads, and earnings.
4. The dashboard shows a high volume of uploads in certain categories, with News and Entertainment leading in this metric.
5. Certain countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, are emerging as significant contributors to video views and subscriber growth.
6. The comparison between unemployment rates and video views by country suggests potential correlations between economic factors and content consumption.

   2. YouTubers and marketers should focus their content strategies on these regions, tailoring content to resonate with these audiences. Additionally, collaborations with influencers from these countries could be a strategic move to increase visibility and subscriber growth.
   3. Expanding into Music and Gaming could provide opportunities for growth, especially for creators looking to diversify their content and tap into new audiences. These categories are particularly appealing to younger demographics and have strong community engagement.
   4.  Maintaining a consistent upload schedule is crucial, especially in competitive categories like News and Entertainment. Creators should aim to balance quantity with quality, ensuring regular content updates to keep their audience engaged while also focusing on delivering high-value content.
   5.  Creators should consider localizing content to cater to these emerging markets. This could include translating content, addressing local trends, or collaborating with regional influencers to boost visibility and engagement in these regions.
   6.  Content creators and brands should monitor economic conditions in key markets and adapt their strategies accordingly. For example, during economic downturns, content that offers escapism or practical advice may resonate more with viewers, leading to increased engagement.
